Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates basic OOP functionality in python as well as some basic plotting 
capabilities using the library matplotlib. Jupyter notebooks is a very unique application. 
This lab truly shows what jupyter can do when visualizing shapes and testing algorithms on 
those shapes at the same time. I am finally starting to dip my feet into the world of data 
science and this lab starts the first of the building blocks to continue learning more complex
algorithms and visualizations.

Files to pay attention to:

lab2.ipynb - Main jupyter file

Instructions for Program:
Must have a working version of JupyterLabs or Jupyter Notebooks. All
you have to do is open the file in one of the two programs listed and execute
each cell one by one from the beginning.
