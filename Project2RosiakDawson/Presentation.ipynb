    "The San Francisco dataset allowed seemed as if most of the data given/attributes were parameters for the underlying population in regards to the type of incident/category. The real question is how deep are you willing to look. One big contrivuter is geological location which is given either as an adress or as a (X,Y) location. This makes sense since certian neghborhoods or certian areas of the city will be known for certian incidents/crimes than others. Like one block may be known for drugs and another street corner may be know for prostituion and rich areas have issues with theft and so on. But if you are willing to look into more of the data most of the given attributes we can think of the ways it will affect what the crime could be. The day of the week since people work typically during the day on week days we can know that most people won;t be in their homes, the time of the day could show a change in category since most robberies don;t happen in the daylight, date can also be a contributor when it is closer to christmas there we can expect more thefts. All of these we can make sense of how they will affect or have some sort of affect on the people doing the crimes. "

Grant it we can make anydata work but we can now visualizes this data on a physical map allowing for use to have a real idea of what the data means and a great visualization for someone who is not as close to the dataset as us. We also used NN because this is something extremely interesting and that it allwos for such diverse inputs and can be edited so much and tweeked so much that we can expect there will be some combination of layers that will yeild good results. That and we can think of this in a real world application because we could make a system where real time police dispatchers can plug in the data they receive from a 911 call and plug it into the NN. This can give the responding police an idea of what to expect. On paper this sounds amazing and especially with the climate of police this would eb a great thing for the news media to get a hold of that police deparements are using. "
