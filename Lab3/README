Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the basic to intermediate functionality of the Pandas
dataframe library. Pandas is used to import data, manipulate data,
and display data in order to draw conclusions and represent data in 
a clear and concise way. Most of the common functions were used such as
pivoting, groupby, sort_values, and various graphs. This lab will be used
as a basis for all future visualizations and computations.
