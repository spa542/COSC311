One number is not \"greater\" than another, it is simply a way of ordering what member has what id. Lastly, itemDescription is discrete because it is nominal categorical finite data. The Member_number is discrete because they are finite whole numeric numbers that represent a categorical ordering rather than a continuous number system. Lastly, the Date is continuous data because time is continuous and the data is not finite. It can be considered discrete because the Date is a set value rather than written down to the exact second, but overall, recorded time is continuous data."

We could use this pivoted data to get a running count of how many dates an specific item was purchased the most, and then see when those dates are to determine when items are more likely to be purchased within the year compared to others. This could be used in a line plot to show trends in purchase history of various items over a certain period of time.

    "This data set is complete because none of the samples have unfilled values. 11 of the 12 attributes that are provided are chemical measurements of the wine. These can be recorded in all instances and are needed to help determing the final attribute being the quality. The quality is useful because the dataset was created to form correlations between the chemical makeup of the wine and the observed \"quality\" of the wine. The quality values are all filled as well because they are pivotal to making further connections with all of the wine samples rather than just  observing strict differences between white and red wine (chemically)."

These are all recorded in order to find differences between red and white wine as well as differences between various types of white wines and red wines. These attributes can be paired with the quality attribute to provide explanations to why some white/red wine might be rated higher or lower quality than others. Is it because some wine is more acidic that it is loved more? Is it because the alcohol content is high that people hate the wine? These are some questions that can be answered when looking at the wine makeup and the quality that the wine sample was rated. All of these features are closely related which is why they are all included."

If there were more attributes of what people thought of each sample, than more correlations could be made. Such as a taste column. Maybe if the wine is more acidic than it will taste more bitter. Or, maybe if there is more alcohol than the wine tastes more smoothe. There should be something more to go off of rather than just a strict quality rating. If there were more attributes about what people thought of each sample (taste-wise), then there could be more things to go off of meaning more correlations to create."

    "One great way to pivot the data is to get the aggregated count of the pH level (index), residual sugar (columns), and the quality rank (values) to create an interesting graphic. This could show the change in quality ranking when you put pH against residual sugar. The aggregated counts would be used for a perfect scatter plot. The plot can be used to see where quality ranks lie as pH levels and residual sugar increase. There could could be a positive correlation there because people like sugar and maybe sugar and acidity go well together. That is just one possible conclusion out of many that could be made using this form of pivoted data. There are a lot of various pivots like this between the various measurement attributes."
