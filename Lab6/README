Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates applications of the machine learning algorithm K-Nearest-Neighbors. This algorithm
is fully implemented using the idea of supervised machine learning and follows the process of training the data,
testing the data, and drawing conclusions using confusion matrices and learning curves. The two datasets that 
KNN is applied to are the iris dataset and the adult dataset. Overall, we see the speed of KNN as we increase
the amount of training points and analyze the accuracy of the algorithm as we increase and decrease the amount
of training points.

Files to pay attention to:

lab6.ipynb - Main jupyter file

iris.data, adult.data - Data CSV files

Instructions for Program:
Must have a working version of JupyterLabs or Jupyter Notebooks. All you have to do is open
the file in one of the two programs listed and execute each cell one by one from the beginning.

**NOTE: The learning curves within the lab are only displaying subsets of the points that are tested.
Despite much effort to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, when working on the adult
dataset, running on the full dataset proves to be much too long for testing needs.
