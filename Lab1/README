Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates basic to advanced python skills. A lot of the lab 
is based on getting familiar with jupyterlabs, jupyter notebooks, and 
getting python code running all alongside each other. Some advanced 
python concepts are practised such as special python keywords along with
list comprehension. Also, some inquiries are made into how to visualize 
the sample data that is tinkered with throughout the lab. Overall, this
lab is to get my feet wet so that I can start getting into advanced data
science techniques and algorithm visualizations.

File to pay attention to:

lab1.ipynb - Main jupyter file

samplepichart.docx - Word doc containing chart to answer a question

Instructions for Program:
Must have a working version of JupyterLabs or Jupyter Notebooks. All
you have to do is open the file in one of the two programs and execute
each cell one by one.

***Answers to problems in lab are within raw cells in jupyter
***Pie chart is in samplepiechart.docx
