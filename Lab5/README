Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates usage of continuous random variables as it pertains to the iris 
data set. We use the Central Limit Theorem to draw large samples from the iris data set
and calculate confidence intervals and correlation coefficients. We also calculated p-values
for the data set to do some hypothesis testing on various data points. Overall, this lab
works closely with the normal distribution as it relates to many real world problems.

Files to pay attention to:

lab5.ipynb - Main jupyter file

iris.data - Data CSV file

Instructions for Program:
Must have a working version of JupyterLabs or Jupyter Notebooks. All you
have to do is open the file in one of the two programs listed and execute
each cell one by one from the beginning.
