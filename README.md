## Course Overview
Provides a foundation in the area of data science based on data curation and statistical
analysis. Learn data analysis concepts and techniques that facilitate making decisions from a rich data set.
Investigate data concepts, metadata creation and interpretation, machine learning, and basics of information
visualization. Learn fundamentals about data standards and methods for organizing, curating, preserving
data for reuse, drawing conclusions and making decisions from data. Understand how to use data analysis
tools for data manipulation, analysis and visualization. Includes discussions on diverse issues around data,
including technologies, behaviors, organizations, policies and society.

## Major Projects:
### Project 1 Analyzing Datasets:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Datasets Used:
* The Wine Quality Dataset
* The Grocery Dataset
* The San Francisco Crime Dataset
#### Description:
This project demonstrates basic analysis of datasets using various graphs and visualization techniques. Conclusions are drawn from these visualizations, interpreted, and then used to make predictions and decisions based off of the data.
### Project 2 San Francisco Crime Dataset Machine Learning Continuation:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Datasets Used:
* The San Francisco Crime Dataset
#### Description:
This project demonstrates the basic functionality and application of the machine learning algorithm K-Nearest Neighbors and our own Neural Network. The project hones in on the San Francisco Crime dataset to draw further conclusions from project 1 with the help of machine learning algorithms.
